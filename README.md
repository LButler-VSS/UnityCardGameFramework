# Overview

This is the beginnings of a personal video game project. The game is to be a deckbuilding rogue-lite. This collection of scripts are my attempts to better learn and understand both general game development principles and Unity specific principles.

The game in its current state is played by clicking on cards that are dealt to you at the bottom of the screen. Each card has a different affect. Press end turn to draw back to 5 cards, or one card if already at 5 or more.

Game design and development has always interested me personally and with a background in Computer Science and many hours spent playing video games, I wanted to try and see what I could make with my own talents.
